1. Figure out what the result will be (True or False) when evaluating
the following expressions, then type them into the interactive window to check your answers:
	(1 <= 1) and (1 != 1)
	not (1 != 2)
	("good" != "bad") or False
	("good" != "Good") and not (1 == 1)


2. Add parentheses where necessary so that each of the following expressions evaluates to True:
	False == not True
	True and False == True and False
	not True and "A" == "B"
	
3. Write a script that prompts the user to enter a word using the
input() function, stores that input in a variable, and then displays
whether the length of that string is less than 5 characters, greater
than 5 characters, or equal to 5 characters by using a set of if, elif
and else statement. 

4. Write a script that prompts user to enter a word using the
input() function, stores that input in a variable, and then displays 
the word in UPPER case if length of word is even else in LOWER case.
